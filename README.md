loanProjectionOptimizer
=======================

Loan Projection Optimizer is a simple javascript app that allows you to configure all of your loans, as well as the available funds you earn to pay into your loans.

It then iterates every month until your loans are paid off to present projections.

If you have extra available funds, you can choose an optimization strategy to see which one works best to pay your loans off the fastest & while spending the least amount of money on interest.

Note that when you update your loan parameters, it stores the information in the URL (in your address bar), so you can actually get everything all set up and bookmark it in your browser and come back to it any time rather than having to enter in your loan information every month.

No financial data whatsoever will be sent across the internet, the entire program works inside your browser.
